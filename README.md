#HRMDB - Hack Reactor Movie Database

Create a movie database and recommendation engine based on the 
open movie database API (OMDb API - http://www.omdbapi.com/). The movie db
should have GET requests to OMDb API based on title and year. The returned
JSON should display on the screen (potentially with some input validation)
with the IMBD/Rotten Tomatoes rating, actors, and director/producer. Users
should be able to vote on and comment on posts. The app should order by 
user votes.

App will be built in Angular with MongoDB storage.
